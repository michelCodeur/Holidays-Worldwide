Project Description

My app is called Holidays Worldwide and as its name implies, it's a collection of holidays information for 230 countries and 3000 states around the world. Users can type in a specific country or state and get all the information related to their holidays and also a brief description of the holiday's meaning for that country. As the API is constantly updating its information, English is the default language for accessing the information but other local languages are available depending on the state or country.

 User Stories
> As a user, I want to see a listing of all the holidays that people of a particular part of the globe celebrate. 
> As a user, I want to see a description of the holiday and its meaning for that particular state or country.
> As a user, I want to navigate between holidays on a phone or tablet and compare holiday celebrations differences between two or more countries.

### MVP Goals
As a user, I want to search for holidays by name so I can compare for exemple who does or doesn't celebrate Christmas around the world.


### Stretch Goals
As a user, I want to search for holidays historically and futuristically until 2049.
