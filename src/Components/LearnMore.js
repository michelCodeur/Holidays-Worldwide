					Holidays Worldwide App gives you access to public, local, and bank
					holidays and observances; and spanning over 230 countries, 3,300+
					states and 100+ languages. The data displayed by the app is provided
					to you by Calendarific, created in 2014, and based on the belief that
					a demand existed for real-time holiday tracking with what appeared to
					be no solution available. While we have put a lot of time and effort
					into ensuring the accuracy and efficiency of our data, we are
					constantly expanding our database and adding more countries. If you
					don't find your country/state/region on this page please let us know
					and we will update it.
